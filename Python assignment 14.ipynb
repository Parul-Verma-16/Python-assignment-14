    "In the RGBA color model, each color component (red, green, and blue) is represented by an integer value ranging from 0 to 255, indicating the intensity of that particular color. The alpha component represents the transparency of the color and is also represented by an integer value ranging from 0 to 255, where 0 indicates fully transparent and 255 indicates fully opaque.\n",
